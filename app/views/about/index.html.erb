      <h3>How it started</h3>
      <p>Galileo started as a research project called “the fact check assistant” and is developed in cooperation
        between "Future Journalism" and Södertörn University. The initial purpose of the assistant was to help
        strengthen confidence in journalistic news produ ction, by supporting editors in finding the balance between a
        fast and credible news production for the digital platforms. The research and processes have culminated in this
        website
        which visualizes key resources and provides practical fact-checking facilitation. </p>
